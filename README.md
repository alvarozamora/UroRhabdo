# Deep Learning Enabled Prediction of 5-Year Survival in Pediatric Genitourinary Rhabdomyosarcoma

This repository is for our 2020 paper entitled, "Deep Learning Enabled Prediction of 5-Year Survival in Pediatric Genitourinary Rhabdomyosarcoma" (under review).

## Usage

### Requirement:
PyTorch 1.4 
Python 3.6

### Getting started: 

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/alvarozamora/UroRhabdo
cd UroRhabdo
```

* Use "preprocessing.py" preprocess the data stored in uro.csv 

* Use "train.py" to train the model. Model architecture is stored in model.py
